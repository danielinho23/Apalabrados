## Introduction

The code and the flow chart shows the logic procedure to create a database with three tables:

 * Numbers. Columns: number - acumulate
 * Text. Columns: text - start - end
 * Characters. Columns: character

Then, there is an input tha should be analized by the algorithm to store it in on of the tables above. It depends on:

  If it is a number, it should be stored in the numbers table. In the number column it will store the number. In the acumulate column it will store the value taking into account the previous ones stored in the same table.
  
  If it is a text, it should store the input in the text table. The input will be stored in the text column. The first and last letters will be stores in the start and end columns respectively.
  
  Is there is an special character in the input it should be stored in the Characters table and the rest of the input is not taking into account.
